Hi! I'm Christian Fuller, a technical writer from the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Previously, I worked as a developer in a scientific computing setting, where I solved production issues with automation and helped a team manage software deployments.

In that role, I found myself writing a fair amount of documentation to help out other developers on my team.
I enjoyed that part of the work so much that I decided to make it my focus.

I attended the University of New Orleans, initially majoring in English before making the switch to Computer Science, graduating magna cum laude in 2023.
