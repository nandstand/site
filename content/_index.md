Hello! I'm Christian Fuller, a technical writer from the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
Previously, I worked as a developer in a scientific computing setting, where I was part of a team that worked with researchers to maintain and deploy software on an HPC cluster.

In that role, I wrote documentation to help onboard developers, authored troubleshooting guides for operations and management staff, and owned the docs for a cross-domain solution.
I enjoyed that part of the work so much that I decided to make it my focus.

I attended the University of New Orleans, initially majoring in English before making the switch to Computer Science, graduating magna cum laude in 2023.
