I managed software integration and deployment, developed a monitoring tool, tracked down production issues, and did my best to write everything I learned down.

I authored troubleshooting guides for operational issues I found fixes for, helped revise standard operating procedures for handling merge conflicts, and owned all of the documentation on a cross-domain solution that I was the point of contact for.
